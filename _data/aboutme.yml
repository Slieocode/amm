  myStory: >-
    <p>Being someone who does not come from an affluent family I was made
    independent at a very young age. I have watched and continue to watch my
    parents, as well as many others, work tirelessly while barely living with
    the hope of scraping by in retirement. Life should not be and does not have
    to be like this.</p> <p>So I decided to change this for myself and by
    creating Aussiemoneyman (AMM), for others also. Started as a simple blog and
    now expanded onto video as well, my goal is to be able to comfortably retire
    before 30 using investing, entrepreneurship and a lot of hard work.</p>
    <p>Being heavily interested in finance and entrepreneurship I am sharing my
    journey and any research I do for myself here in this blog and/or on my
    YouTube channel which can be found <a target="_base"
    href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjdDTZcTHWsBKYw0z5H_6g"><span
    class="underline">Here</span></a>. <p>Currently, I have started multiple
    small businesses including some in eCommerce, written multiple eBooks, made
    thousands a month in affiliate marketing, invested in the stock market and
    P2P lending platforms and gained some very valuable mentors. </p> <p>In the
    future, I hope to become completely independent of any employers and work
    with others to educate in the power of taking control of one's finances.</p>
