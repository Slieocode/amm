    I founded <span class="underline">AMM</span> with the simple goal of sharing
    my extensive research with others.  <span class="underline">Australian
    Personal Finance</span>  Let me be frank, we as humans are all lazy, we want
    the most for doing the least. It is fundamental human nature and I am no
    different, I just happen to have a lot of motivation to assure it. I took it
    to the next step when I decided to create <span class="underline">AMM</span>
    and share that with you.
  myStory: >-
    <p>Being someone who does not come from an affluent family I was made
    independent at a very young age. I have watched and continue to watch my
    parents, as well as many others, work tirelessly while barely living with
    the hope of scraping by in retirement. Life should not be and does not have
    to be like this. Many people like to assume that I had some special
    connections or wealthy parents, but this is simply not the case, in fact it
    seems I have had it a bit hard. </p> <p>So, I decided to change this for
    myself and by creating Aussiemoneyman (AMM), for others also. Started as a
    simple blog and now expanded into this site as well as on YouTube and a lot
    of hard work.</p> <p>Being heavily interested in finance and
    entrepreneurship I am sharing my journey and any research I do for myself
    here in this blog and/or on our YouTube channel which can be found <a

    href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjdDTZcTHWsBKYw0z5H_6g"><span
    class="underline">Here</span></a>. <p>Currently, I have started multiple
    small businesses including some in eCommerce, written multiple eBooks, made
    thousands a month in affiliate marketing, invested in the stock market, both
    actively and passively, and P2P lending platforms, partnered with some of
    the biggest companies in their industry and gained some very valuable
    mentors. </p> <p>Despite my love for various employee dependent roles and my
    experience working for both the State and Federal Australian Governments
    before 20 at some point in the future, I hope to become completely
    independent of any employers and work with others to educate in the power of
    taking control of one's finances.</p>
