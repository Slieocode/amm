  blurp: I founded <span class="underline">AMM</span> with the simple goal of
    sharing my extensive research with others. Let me be frank, we as humans are
    all lazy, we want the most for doing the least. It is fundamental human
    nature and I am no different, I just happen to have a lot of motivation to
    assure it. I took it to the next step when I decided to create <span
    class="underline">AMM</span> and share that motivation and subsequent
    research  with you.
  myStory: <p>Being someone who does not come from an affluent family I was made
    independent at a very young age. I have watched and continue to watch my
    parents, as well as many others, work tirelessly while barely living with
    the hope of scraping by in retirement. Life should not be and does not have
    to be like this. Many people like to assume that I had some special
    connections or wealthy parents, but this is simply not the case, in fact it
    seems I have had it a bit hard. </p> <p>So, I decided to change this for
    myself and by creating Aussiemoneyman (AMM), for others also. Started as a
    simple blog and now expanded into this site as well as on our YouTube
    channel I have grown AMM significantly and have received hundreds of
    contacts thanking me for it.  .</p> <p>Being heavily interested in finance
    and entrepreneurship I am sharing my journey and any research I do for
    myself here in this blog and/or on our YouTube channel which can be found <a

    href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjdDTZcTHWsBKYw0z5H_6g"><span
    class="underline">Here</span></a>. <p>Currently, I have started multiple
    small businesses including some in eCommerce, written multiple eBooks, made
    tens of thousands a month in affiliate marketing, invested in the stock
    market, both actively and passively, and P2P lending platforms, partnered
    with some of the biggest companies in their industry and gained some very
    valuable mentors. </p> <p>Despite my love for various roles where being an
    employee is required and my experience working for both the State and
    Federal Australian Governments before age 20 I decided to go Full-time with
    AussieMoneyMan at the start of 2019. </p>
