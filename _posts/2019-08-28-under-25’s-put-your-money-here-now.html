<p>So, I always mention how I like to keep at least 3-6k in an emergency fund that is kept in a high interest savings account (In Australia for over 25's that is Ubank at 2.87%). However, for us youngies great news! We can now receive 4.00% on up to $10,000. This is a pretty big deal, I will likely increase my cash holdings to 10k just for this 4% return given the current analysts comments regarding a recession.</p>

<p>Reading the fine print I also found the first month will be paid at the base interest rate and if you meet the above mentioned criteria you will then start receiving the sweet sweet 4%.</p>

<h2><span class="underline">Question time:</span></h2>

<p><b>Q:</b> What is this magical bank offering 4% to under 25's?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> Bank of Queensland (BOQ)</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What happens if I go over the 10k? </p>

<p><b>A:</b> You get your 4% on the 10k and 2.80% on any excess</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What if I am over 25?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> You can only get their 2.80% offer, so you would be better off with <a href="#">Ubank</a></p>

<p><b>Q:</b> What are the conditions?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> You will need to deposit a minimum of $200 a month ($50 a week) into the account. However, there is no minimum account balance and you can transfer all you like.</p>
