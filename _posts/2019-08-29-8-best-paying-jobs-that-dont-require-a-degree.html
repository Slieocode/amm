We all want a well paying job but not all of us can or want to go to university. So what jobs pay the best without having a degree? As someone without a degree, I know this topic well!

<br>

<br>

I always say you will get paid well for one or more of three things, being skilled, doing something no one wants to do/is dangerous or by managing/leading people. I will list which one of these categories I think each of these fit under.

<h2>Youth Officer/Worker (Mix of all three):</h2>

<p>This is what I did, the base is roughly 65k, however, when you add on the shift allowances (and if you are casual, casual loading), this quickly goes up significantly, I was turning over the equivalent of 90k here and knew people who made up to 130k a year in this role.</p>



<h2>Air Traffic Controller (skill):</h2>

<p>This one is at the end because you do need some qualification that that is a pilots licence! Though it does come with a sweet 108k salary.</p>



<h2>Real Estate Agent (Skill):</h2>

<p>The skill here is sales and this blends strongly with any sales role, sales are hard but if you are good at them you will make good money. I know plenty of people as young as 18 who have gone into real estate and absolutely smashed it making well over 100k.</p>



<h2>General Management (Leading):</h2>

<p>I know many people personally that fall into this category from grocerie store managers, to farm mangers to gym managers. These guys can normally can expect a nice 85k.</p>

<h2>Ethical Hacker (Skill):</h2>

<p>These guys are highly skilled but are lucky enough to not require a degree, I know someone personally making well over 100k doing this and he is barely 23. These guys can expect a starting salary of about 130k.</p>



<h2>Sales (Skill):</h2>

<p>This one is a bit of a double whammy in that it requires good sales skills and plenty of people hat sales so it reduces competition and drives up wages. This includes car sales people who can expect a healthy 75k salary.</p>



<h2>Electrician and Plumber (Skill):</h2>

<p>These guys are the king when it comes to the best paying trades and are definitely worthy of this list with a nice 85 and 75k salary respectively.</p>



<h2>Care Worker (Difficult):</h2>

<p>You can jump on various sites and apply for this one with no qualifications though experience helping the elderly or disabled helps. You will start on a rate of at least $30 an hour. A role like this will net you at least 70k. </p>
