So, there are a lot of scammy 'make money online' sites and people out there, however, I can personally vouch for each of the following as they are all things I have done.

<br>

<br>

Please check out our new <a href="http://bit.ly/2QTH75k">YouTube channel</a>.	

</p>



<h2>Affiliate Marketing</h2>

<p>

This is where you help sell other people’s products or services and earn a commission. I made over $600 in my first month of doing this, so it is definitely a real and profitable way to make money online.

<br>

<br>

There are sites out there like ClickBank, JvZoo and CJ that list some of the highest paying affiliate programs. I, however, recommend simply looking out for products and services you use yourself or at least greatly trust and contacting them about a possible affiliation. I personally only promote products or services for things I use myself. This allows me to build and maintain trust with my audience while making some extra cash on the side.

<br>

<br>

If you have any questions on how to get started in affiliate marketing please do comment below or contact me on social media.

</p>

<h2>E-commerce</h2>

<p>

This can be Amazon FBA, drop shipping or any other method. While this one can be a bit hard to learn, there is a wealth of knowledge online today. Particularly on YouTube due to the rise of Shopify drop shipping YouTubers. Though please be careful with those trying to sell their courses, most are NOT worth your money.

<br>

<br>

I personally dropship using Shopify and while I am yet to make thousands a day, I have been able to turn over up to $160 a day in very early days.

</p>



<h2>Influencer accounts</h2>

<p>

Influencer accounts refers to using social media accounts with a following to run promotions for cash. I personally created two of these on Instagram and was able to get some easy cash from it. I was hacked when I was starting to get big and make some real money, so I never got to see much more than $5-10 per promotion. However, as someone who often pays influencers to advertise my products, I can confidently say they make some great money for simply posting a product or service endorsement. I sometimes pay upwards of $100 per post.	

</p>



<h2>eBooks/Courses</h2>

<p>

If you have a skill of some sort you can probably teach it online via a course, eBook or similar means. I have done this myself with an eBook in a very niche area. Examples that are common right now are Shopify courses, blogging and digital marketing. A LOT of people are making courses on these topics, and unfortunately a lot of them are bogus snake oil. Please do not become one of those guys. I like to suggest finding a niche area that you are interested and skilled in and making quality work that people will thank you for. My eBook has nothing to do with anything online like most are. You can make a course on literally anything as long as there is a demand for it.	

</p>



<h2>Online Surveys</h2>

<p>So this was mentioned here and I am actually currently working on a full in-depth post on the topic as people want to know more! So if you are one of those people head here to subscribe to be notified when it comes out:  It will include a full list of the best sites and how I find them.

<br>

<br>

There are many that pay up to $80 for only 30 minutes of your time so definitely keep an eye out for more on this.

</p>



<h2>P2P Lending</h2>

<p>

If you follow my YouTube channel you know I am an investor in P2P Lending. P2P Lending (when done right) can offer amazing returns at a fair risk level which can, in turn, can make you some great returns. Which means online income! Read more here.	

</p>



<h2>Stocks</h2>

<p>

Similar concept to above. By investing in stocks (wisely) whether it be long or short term you can make some extra income online. It can be from dividends (a sum of money paid regularly by a company to its shareholders) or by company growth (capital gains). Known as dividend and capital gains investing respectively. I personally am heavily invested in the stock market and enjoy great returns from it. Of course, you need to take extreme care here and should consult a professional if you have any doubts!
