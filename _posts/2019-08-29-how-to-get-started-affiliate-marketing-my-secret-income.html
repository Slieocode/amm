<h2>What is Affiliate Marketing:</h2>

<p>

Affiliate marketing is the process of selling other peoples products or services. Now I am sure you can see the potential this has straight away, you can be paid, what is sometimes, big money to sell products or services you didn't have to make.	

</p>

<h2>Why do it:</h2>



<p>

Let us break down why affiliate marketing is so attractive: 

<br>

<br>

\-You can <b>make money from other peoples products or services </b>

<br>

<br>

\-You <b>don't have to 'do sales'</b>

<br>

<br>

\-It can be 100% <b>passive</b> 	

</p>



<h2>How to do it:</h2>



<p>

For example, as I have mentioned in the past I use affiliate marketing when I want to share something that may have a paid service or product as a part of it. This is just one way of utilizing affiliate marketing but is my personal favorite as it means I do not have to 'sell' it so to speak, I can simply link a product or service I may be reviewing or talking about and make money from it passively (meaning you will be making money even after you have done the work, possibly for years)!	

<br>

<br>

All those review sites and channels you see use affiliate marketing, let us use the new iPhone review as an example, chances are the there will be a link to the product somewhere and there is a good chance that link is an affiliate link. This means the content creator gets paid every-time someone purchases from that link. But wait it gets much better. Remember, that creator is already making money from site ads and/or YouTube ad revenue among other things so this is just another income source. Sometimes these links even have 'cookies' that allow you to be paid if they buy within a certain time-frames (commonly 3 months) and/or to be paid if they buy anything else from the site after clicking through to it via your link, this opens up a whole new realm of possibility

</p>



<h2>A list of examples:</h2>

<p>

So here is a list of some great affiliate programs for us Aussies to use:

<br>

<br>

<a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/">-Amazon Affiliate Program</a>

<br>

<br>

<a href="https://partnernetwork.ebay.com.au/">-eBay Partner Network</a>

<br>

<br>

\-Literally any product or service you use (This is what I do, I simply make my content as usual and if I talk about a product or service I will see if it has an affiliate program and slip it in)!

<br>

<br>

There are also sites like <a href="http://ngm2219.reseller.hop.clickbank.net/">Click-Bank</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/2Led7i0">Maxbounty</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2W7eO1F">FlexOffers</a> and <a href="https://www.jvzoo.com/register/1203567">JVZOO</a> you will hear of, these sites are just big lists of affiliate programs but most are not available to us Australians so this is just another reason not to simply promote products you are already talking about by reaching out to the business that owns it after the fact rather than the opposite which involves trying to sell them to people. Though I am not against this, it can be done, but it is definitely a whole different ball game and requires a lot more work.
