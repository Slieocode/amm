There have been quite a few requests and mentions for me to share my portfolio so that is exactly what this post will be about. I started investing about 12 months ago now and will set out the percentages of where my money is and a bit about the reasoning behind each decision. I will not be sharing the amounts at this point, however, as I do not fully understand potential negative effects that could be had in response to doing so.

<br>

It is important to note as always, while all the information is provided in faith that it is accurate and reliable. It is to be noted I am NOT a financial adviser and information given is purely my opinion on discussed matters. It is always recommended you speak to a financial adviser before making any financial decisions you may not be sure of.  

<br>

As of the 13/12/18, my portfolio is broken down as follows:

</p>

<h2><span class="underline">Stocks: 51.3%</span></h2>

<p>

My stock portfolio is made up of 8 stocks 1 of which is an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). The choice of owning 8 stocks was made using data from 'How to be a stock market genius' by Joel Greenblatt where Joel discusses how after owning 8 stocks in your portfolio the rate of risk reduction change dramatically decreases. Further, I have had difficulties finding good, cheap, undervalued companies in the current market. Of my 8 stocks, 4 are US stocks and the remaining 4 Australian. The Australian stocks were chosen due to franking and the US because even without the franking they still performed equal to or better than the Australian stocks as far as I could tell.

</p>

<h2><span class="underline">P2P: 13.8%</span></h2>

<p>

About 15% is invested in P2P Lending platforms. If you follow this blog, you would know I am a fan of P2P and have made quite a bit of content on the topic. I think when done correctly P2P Lending can be a very profitable and relatively safe investment. I am invested across multiple P2P platforms and even more so across borrowers. The main two platforms I invest in are Ratesetter and Trupillars. You can read more about each here.

</p>

<h2><span class="underline">Super: 25.7%</span> (Note this only includes funds I have sacrificed into my super voluntarily and does not include employer contributions)</h2>

<p>

For tax purposes over a quarter of my wealth has been invested into my super and hence my retirement. This does not include employer contributions. 

</p>

<h2><span class="underline">Cash: 9.1%</span></h2>

<p>

About 10% of my wealth is held in cash as a safety net.

<br>

If there is anything more, I could add please comment below and share your thoughts.

<h1>Note:</h1>

<p>Obviously I have not included my liabilities as they are not a part of my investment portfolio, however, if included would account for roughly 14% of my net worth.</p>
