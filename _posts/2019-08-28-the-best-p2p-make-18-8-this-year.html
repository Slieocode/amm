After writing about P2P lending in Australia quite a bit lately, I figured I might go into depth on each. Today we will discuss Rate Setter and why they might just be the best option for you. I also have a little surprise at the end. Let’s start with the basics. 

<br>

It is important to note as always, while all the information is provided in faith that it is accurate and reliable. It is to be noted I am NOT a financial adviser and information given is purely my opinion on discussed matters. It is always recommended you speak to a financial adviser before making any financial decisions you may not be sure of.

<p>

<h2>What is P2P Lending:</h2>

<p>

Peer to peer lending match’s people who have money to invest with people who are looking for a loan. A more appropriate term for this practice is marketplace lending because an online platform, usually a website, is used to match investors with borrowers. Over the last three years, we have seen a huge increase in the prevalence of such investment providers. Even though the term marketplace lending best describes this type of lending, on this page we refer to it as peer to peer lending (or P2P lending) as these are the terms most people use. 

</p>

<h2>Why P2P Lending:</h2>

<p>

There are a host of reasons why you may choose to invest through p2p lending. These included diversifying my investments outside of stocks, a high return on investment, and an easy method of investing. The rate of return simply comes from the fact the platforms are purely online meaning less overhead costs and thus can offer lower interest loans.

</p>

<h2>What is RateSetter:</h2>

<p>

RateSetter is simply a P2P lending platform. So assuming you are convinced that you would like to put some money into a P2P lending platform in order to grow your money while you sleep. Why pick this one? After all, there are other options. Read on to find out why it may be the best one for you.</p>

<h2>How does RateSetter Work?</h2>

<p>

Simply, you are acting as a bank and loan the money. The borrows then borrow your money and pay it back over a period with interest. 

</p>

<p>

<br>

RateSetter ensures they are creditworthy, match lenders and borrowers orders, provide loan administration services, manage loan payments and manage claims on the Provision Fund . 

<br>

All together you have RateSetters system.

</p>

<h2>Why RateSetter:</h2>

<p>

It is simply less risky. RateSetter is one of the oldest and hence well-established P2P platforms in Australia and thus has significantly reduced platform risk. Moreover, they are big. This adds to the mitigation of platform risk, Ratesetter is one of the largest platforms worldwide.

</p>

</p>

<p>

Next, their provision fund acts as somewhat of a safety net and while it won’t save you from everything, definitely adds another layer of protection. 

<br>

No one has lost money yet. Since RateSetters inception in 2014, no lender has lost their capital. Currently, there is just under 11 million AUD in the fund.

<br>

You can see what Ratesetter says about it here: 

</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

The money in the Provision Fund comes from charges paid by borrowers. RateSetter is able to direct the Provision Fund trustee to compensate a lender in the event of a borrower late payment or default. Though we believe the Provision Fund provides meaningful protection for investors, it is important to remember it is not a guarantee nor an insurance product, and your capital is at risk.  

</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

They have experience. RateSetter may be only on its 4th year in Australia but  has been operating in the UK since 2009 facilitating over 4.0 billion AUD in loans with equally great success. Moreover, it has one of the longest track records in Australia when compared to other platforms.  

You can invest from $10 AUD. This is quite rare in P2P, a lot of providers require a minimum of 10x this and some 100x.

</p>

<h2>RateSetter Compared:</h2>

<p>

Long story short RateSetter acts as one of the most if not the most risk mitigated platforms but also normally has an expectedly lower return in consequence. You can compare more here: https://www.aussiemoneyman.com.au/blog/p2p-lending-platforms-compared-australia However, at least this time around you may be able to get the best of both worlds.

<h2>How you can get 18.8% this year with RateSetter and my help:</h2> 

<p>

After reaching out to rate setter, I was offered a unique referral link that gets you $100 on your $1000 investment (10%) on either a 3-year or 5 year term (at the current standard rate for a 5 year term of 8.8% pa for 5 years and 7.4% for 3). This comes to 18.8% and 17.4% respectively!

<br>

<p>So, if you are keen to invest and make a whopping 19% on your investment, give it a try now by clicking

I actually used this deal myself a few months back and here is proof. As you can see by the screenshot, I invested $1000 (on loan) and then immediately got $100 bonus (promotions) as well as due interest over time.
