The ban on sign up bonuses, the incentives bookies provide for signing up to their bookie normally in the form of a matched deposit, did not come entirely as a surprise. There seems to have been rumors about this being <a href="https://bettingsite.com.au/bonus-bet-ban/">posted</a> about for years before it ultimately occurring in late May 2019. But what does this mean for you matched betters?

Well the truth is no one knows just yet. Firstly, you will need to understand the ban is a result in changes in National law and not that of choice by the bookies. Between this and the fact that bookies will always need some sort of incentive to keep bringing in new customers to their sites, we can confidently say bonuses will still be given just within the rules. This will likely be in the form of a email or text after you have signed up in lieu of a external ad off site as it used to be.

<br>

What about on-going promotions? This particular law change should not effect the on-going promos nor their profitability.

<br>

<br>

So basically, the overall profits to be made should not change but the steps to make money from sign up bonuses (up to $5000 AUD) might be a little bit more difficult to achieve.

<br>

<br>

The good out of this is that bookies may go ahead and use other methods to get people to gamble with them which might mean some extra cash to be made. Further, Australia does seem to have a lot of problem gamblers  so it seems the new laws will bring good to them.

<h2>Summary:</h2>

<h2>-On-going will not be effected</h2>

<h2>-Sign-up bonuses may for the short-term be more difficult to acquire</h2>

<h2>-The ban will help many and possibly matched betters into the future</h2>
