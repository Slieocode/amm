Want an unusual but extremely effective way of making thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars? Of course you do. I was at work a few months back now and a kid mentioned to me he was making 'thousands' in a day. I immediately assumed the worst, however, was quickly enlightened that he was making the money from this magical thing called support role castings.

<br>

<br>

Before you read on please check out our new YouTube channel <a href="http://bit.ly/2QTH75k">here</a>.

I had to check it out and immediately jumped online to apply for some myself. I found various sites (casting agencies) and started applying. I was able to be short-listed for three castings worth, two, twelve, and one thousand respectively within 2 months with almost no effort.

<br>

<br>

So you might be thinking, but I can't act. Yeah, well either can I but that is why I said support roles. These are where you often do not speak at all and are more or less a filler and get paid to do it. If, however, you can speak to a camera, you can apply for TV ads where you may have a star part and make the big bucks.

<br>

<br>

So how is this helpful to you? Well now you know you can do this if you did not already but here is a list of all the casting agencies I have found so far:
