\-Your income is taxed in parts or brackets. The entire income is not taxed in a single bracket

\-Tax deductible simply means you get the overall percentage of tax you pay on your income back not the whole thing!

\-Your second job is taxed at 50%, I have heard this one a lot. This is simply not the case, the ATO does not care how many jobs you have.

\-you cannot claim laundry unless you have a uniform or occupation unspecific clothing

\-Doing your tax right away is often a bad idea

\-There are some things you just cannot claim

\-You cannot claim things you already was reimbursed for by your employer 

\-You actually do need records for work related expenses or you cannot claim them

\-You still need to have spend the money when claiming the non-evidence threshold

\-Course costs or any other cost related to a future potential income is not tax deductible as it is not directly related to your current income

\-You cannot claim property deductions when the rental property was not up for rent

\-Like anything else, you have to pay Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on bitcoin (BTC) earnings
