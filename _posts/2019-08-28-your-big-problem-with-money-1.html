<p>Bad job? No, Too far away? Nope, A better offer? Not quite</p>

<p>Frankly the reason lies in the value of time. Sure, I could take the role and enjoy a comfortable $2500 a week from work alone.</p>

<p>But the downfall quickly becomes apparent if you are a person who desires efficiency. Let's start by pointing out the main issue, a lack of potential growth. Sure, I could work my way up over time and end up on 150k or more, but this takes, you guessed it time. I am confident I can make my time more valuable and thus taking the job is simply selling myself short. Moreover, there is a ceiling with almost all jobs regarding how much you can make and this limits your earning potential.

</p>

<p>Next, it means a lot less free time and flexibility. Working full-time results in less time being available to do things that can make you money for a long time (passive income) as well as reducing your flexibility which is important when looking for new opportunities to expand your wealth or life in general. You become locked down.

</p>

<p>This leads me onto my next point, this and the routine of it all would simply drive me crazy. As someone with the entrepreneur mindset, I need the ability to be flexible, always grow and to decide what I do on my own terms. The idea of it alone frustrates me.</p>

<p>Financially, I once heard that you should never only work for money. The role I was to perform would have made me money as a job should but would not have taught me the skills I need to get to where I want to be. This was definitely a big factor in my decision.</p>

<p>*This post has gained a lot of attention recently and I would like to point out, I am not saying do not work, I am simply saying a FT job may not be best for you if you can afford to work part-time or casual and work on your own projects in your free time as I do.</p>
